# Auto Messaging on Facebook using Selenium

## Introduction

This project is aimed at automating the process of sending messages on Facebook using the Python Selenium library. It can be used to send messages to friends or anyone on Facebook. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium library
- A Facebook account
- Chrome webdriver

## How to run the project

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the chrome webdriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place it in the project folder.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `facebook_messenger.ipynb` and follow the instructions provided in the notebook.
5. Replace the Facebook username and password with your own in the notebook code.
6. Run the code cells to send messages on Facebook.

## How it works

The script uses the Selenium library to automate the process of logging in to Facebook, navigating to the messaging section, and sending messages to the specified recipient. It does this by interacting with the elements on the webpage using their Xpaths.

## Conclusion

This project is a simple implementation of how Selenium can be used to automate tasks on websites. It can be used as a starting point for more complex projects that require web automation.
